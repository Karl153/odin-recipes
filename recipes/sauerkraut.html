    <h1>Sausage and Sauerkraut</h1>
     <img src="../images/sauerkraut.png">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> Sauerkraut and sausage is a hearty dish that combines tangy, fermented cabbage (sauerkraut) with savory sausages, typically bratwurst or kielbasa.
          The sauerkraut's sharp, sour flavor complements the rich, meaty taste of the sausages, often cooked together with onions, garlic, and spices.
          It is a popular comfort food in German and Eastern European cuisines.
